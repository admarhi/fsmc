<p>These results indicate that cooperative communities are functionally
more similar to each other than competitive communities. With the
minimum alignment set to 50% there is a great discrepancy between the
extent of the alignment of cooperative and competitive communities. This
becomes even more pronounced in the alignment &gt;80%, here only the
glycerol -&gt; glycerol edge is present in competitive communities,
while in the cooperative communities the production of hydrogen sulfide
and ammonia from a variety of compounds are present.</p>
<p>We can use the <code>compareAlignments</code> function to compare the
alignments and find values, at which the alignments contain the same
number of reactions.</p>

the interactive version of the plot we decide to compare
alignments that align ~250 reactions in both, at a fraction of 0.51 (245
reactions) for cooperative and 0.31 (244 reactions) for competitive. The
same for 130 reactions, 0.63 and 0.39 for cooperative and competitive
respectively.</p>
