# Classes in `fsmc`
`fsmc` is built around classes which simplify common workflows with microbial communities. 

- Implement S4 and why?
- How to use classes


## MiCo
The `MiCo` class serves as the standard way to save and work with data on the metabolism of a microbial community. Read more about the class in the [MiCo class documentation](class-MiCo.html).


## MiCoAl
The `MiCoAl` class serves as the standard way to align one or more `MiCo` objects. Read more about the class in the [MiCoAl class documentation](class-MiCoAl.html).
