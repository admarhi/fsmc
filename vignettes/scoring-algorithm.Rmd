The identity matrix is given as the non-redundant count of reactions in the given level of the alignment over the count of all reactions in the set of consortia.

BM = binary matrix representing all edges in the set of consortia


$$ \sum \text{BM} - \left( \sum_{i < j} A^{(2)}(i,j)  + A^{(N)} \right) - \left( \sum_{i < j < k} A^{(3)}(i,j,k)  + A^{(N)} \right) $$


- How does this score compare against the tanimoto coefficient?
