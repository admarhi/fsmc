# Experiment 2

- Set of 20 species
- 10 consortia with 5-10 species each
- each consortia in 2 different types of media
- align the solutions for each media type 
- identify central and peripheral consortia
- compare the central and peripheral consortia by running them in 10 different types of media

Questions:
- Are central consortia more optimised/generalist?
- Are peripheral consoria elastic/adaptable or specialists?
